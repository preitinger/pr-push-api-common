# pr-push-api-common
One of 3 repositories (pr-push-api-common, pr-push-api-client, pr-push-api-server) which provide corresponding data types and functions in Typescript for an easy standard use case of the Javascript Push API

Web client projects should include pr-push-api-common and pr-push-api-client as submodules.

Web server projects should include pr-push-api-common and pr-push-api-server as submodules.

Fullstack projects all 3 of them, of course.

Server projects additionally need a dependency on the NPM library project 'web-push'.
